# SpringCore #

because the jar.file path is following my computer. 
The Reference Libraries's jar.file path is C:\Users\user\eclipse-workspace\spring-demo-one\lib\xxx.jar
So you have 2 choice below
1.You can build the same path in your computer and put the jar.file in lib into the folder.
2.Go to eclipse and right-click this project folder and select build-path > Configure Build Path > delete all error jar 
and select Libraries > Add External JARs > then select all jar.file in the project's lib folder.
